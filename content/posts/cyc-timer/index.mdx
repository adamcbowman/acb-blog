Over the past couple days, I put together a little web app to support club racing at the [Charlottetown Yacht Club](http://cyc.pe.ca). 

Check it out [here](http://cyc-timer.herokuapp.com)

For now the app doesn't handle scoring, but is just a simple timer app with a list of our boats. 

I added some CRUD database operations just for adding/editing boat names, but the timing is all just front end client side (for now at least). It's built using NextJS and a firestore database. 

Fun project!
